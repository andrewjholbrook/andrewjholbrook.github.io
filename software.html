      <li> <a href="https://github.com/suchard-group/MassiveMDS" target="_blank">MassiveMDS: massively parallel multidimensional scaling library</a> facilitates fast Bayesian MDS through GPU, multi-core CPU, and SIMD vectorization powered implementations of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. The package may be built either as a standalone library or as an R package relying on Rcpp.
          GPU capabilities for either build require installation of OpenCL computing framework. 
      <li> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppXsimd/index.html" target="_blank">Xsimd C++ Header-Only Library Files</a> provides modern, portable C++ wrappers for SIMD intrinsics and parallelized, optimized math implementations (SSE, AVX, NEON, AVX512). By placing this library in this package, we offer an efficient distribution system for Xsimd <https://github.com/QuantStack/xsimd> for R packages using CRAN.
